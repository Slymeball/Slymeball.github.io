        <h1 class="margin0">figura models</h1>
        <p class="margin0">
            just a brief description: figura is a minecraft mod that allows more freedom with minecraft models by allowing users to make custom models and scripts for their "avatars" to use.<br>
            now that that's out of the way, here are my figura models that i'm sharing:
        </p>
        <h2 class="margin0" style="margin-top: 10px;">axolotl</h2>
        <p class="margin0">
            i only ever got around to making the little things on the sides of their heads, but that's ok since most axolotl skins have some covering on the body.<br>
            <a href="https://github.com/Slymeball/figura-models/raw/main/Axolotl.zip">download</a>
        </p>
        <h2 class="margin0" stype="margin-top: 10px;">glass helmet <em style="color:#ff0000;font-style:none">NEW!</em></h2>
        <p class="margin0">
            it's a glass block around your head. it even uses 16x instead of what i would've made it if i never learned about scale inflation<br>

        </p>
        <h2 class="margin0" style="margin-top: 10px;">ham head</h2>
        <p class="margin0">
            idk man, it's just a ham in the head<br>

        </p>
        <h2 class="margin0" style="margin-top: 10px;">jello</h2>
        <p class="margin0">
            basically, it's just a plate of green jello on your head.<br>
            <em style="color:#ff0000;font-style:none">UPDATE:</em> fixed the nameplate, finally.<br>

        </p>
        <h2 class="margin0" style="margin-top: 10px;">shulker set</h2>
        <p class="margin0">
            some day recently, my brain decided it was going to make a shulker shell cosmetic. now it exists and it's here for you.<br>
            this is a 3 in one because i can't be f*cked to make three different download links. you have to unzip it<br>

        </p>
        <h2 class="margin0" style="margin-top: 10px;">sunflower</h2>
        <p class="margin0">
            this was my first figura model. when i first created it, nothing had rotation and the flower tail didn't even exist. i expanded upon it some days and now it's at this point.<br>
            <em style="color:#ff0000;font-style:none">UPDATE:</em> fixed the nameplate, finally.<br>

            go do whatever with the files above, i don't give a flying sh*t.
