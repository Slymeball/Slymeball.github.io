        <h1 class="margin0">figura models</h1>
        <p class="margin0">
            just a brief description: figura is a minecraft mod that allows more freedom with minecraft models by allowing users to make custom models and scripts for their "avatars" to use.<br>
            now that that's out of the way, here are my figura models that i'm sharing:
        </p>
        <h2 class="margin0" style="margin-top: 10px;">axolotl</h2>
        <p class="margin0">
            i only ever got around to making the little things on the sides of their heads, but that's ok since most axolotl skins have some covering on the body.<br>
            <a href="https://github.com/Slymeball/figura-models/raw/main/Axolotl.zip">download</a>
        </p>
        <h2 class="margin0" style="margin-top: 10px;">ham head</h2>
        <p class="margin0">
            after watching at least a few animations of "the ballad of hamantha" i made this. you're welcome.<br>
            <a href="https://github.com/Slymeball/figura-models/raw/main/Ham%20Head.zip">download this mfer</a>
        </p>
        <h2 class="margin0" style="margin-top: 10px;">shulker set</h2>
        <p class="margin0">
            some day recently, my brain decided it was going to make a shulker shell cosmetic. now it exists and it's here for you.<br>
            this is a 3 in one because i can't be fucked to make three different download links. you have to unzip it<br>
            <a href="https://github.com/Slymeball/figura-models/raw/main/Shulker%20Set%20(unzip).zip">just get it</a>
        </p>
        <h2 class="margin0" style="margin-top: 10px;">sunflower</h2>
        <p class="margin0">
            this was my first figura model. when i first created it, nothing had rotation and the flower tail didn't even exist. i expanded upon it some days and now it's at this point.<br>
            <a href="https://github.com/Slymeball/figura-models/raw/main/Sunflower.zip">yeah</a>
