# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
## Who am I?
To put it short, I'm a "programmer." Longer, I'm just a random male making stuff for people to use, while wanting to learn more.
## What do I do?
Not much, all I've done so far is make Skript files.

## What am I hoping to do?
Probably make Phone apps. Websites too, probably.
## What all have you done on GitHub?
This and...
